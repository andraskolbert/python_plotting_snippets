python_plotting_snippets
========================

A series of code snippets to make it easier to create nice and useful plots with python.

The plots are mostly based on the [seaborn library](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/),
but also the good 'ol [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).
Each example comes in the form of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.
